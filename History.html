            <div class Par><p class="fi">According to Prasanna (2020), patriotism is defined as a strong attachment to and love for one’s homeland. It entails zeal and unwavering support for the country. 
                <br><br>A patriot is someone who respects and keeps their country’s flag flying high. Love and devotion to a country are essential components of a nation’s development.On today’s society, 
                people especially Gen Zs in the Philippines tend to be less patriotic, this is because of westernization. According to StudyMoose (2016), in sectors such as industry, technology, law, politics, 
                economics, lifestyle, diet, clothes, language, alphabet, religion, philosophy, and values. Westernization is a process in which civilizations are influenced by Western culture. This approach is 
                a major contributor to the absence of nationalism or patriotism among today’s youngsters. The conventions include idolizing Korean pop, adoring imported goods, and imitating foreign trends.<br><br> 
                However, now that the elections are bound to happen in May 2022 in the Philippines, Filipino Gen Zs tend to be updated about that topic, because they realize that their vote, their opinions will matter 
                and will determine their future and the country’s future.<br><Br>With this one example, we can see that Gen Zs are inculcating patriotism nowadays. They tend to be future-oriented for the country and to 
                build a healthy society for the next generation. In addition, Gen Zs are instilling patriotic values to themselves by being aware of what is happening in their environment. Others may think that they
                are not patriotic enough to the country because they are following foreign trends, but despite that fact, Gen Zs can still love the country and keep the country’s ideologies and culture by being careful 
                to their actions and also passionate for the country’s good future. It is fortunate that Gen Zs or the youths are instilling those patriotic values to themselves, because they are the country’s future.  
                Youth is frequently referred to be the country’s future. They will help to improve our country’s status as leaders in numerous fields. Because they are concerned about the country’s future, the youth 
                have a strong sense of patriotism and openly and passionately voice their thoughts. We owe it to the nation that has helped us so much to appreciate and give back to it. We must love and safeguard our 
                country while keeping the principles of our constitution alive. </p>
